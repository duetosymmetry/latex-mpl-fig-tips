This repo is a supplement to the post [Fonts/sizes in matplotlib
figures for LaTeX
publications](https://duetosymmetry.com/code/latex-mpl-fig-tips/) on
my web site.  If you haven't read the post yet, go check it out.  If
you've already read the post, you're probably most interested in:
- [latex-mpl-fig-tips.tex](latex-mpl-fig-tips.tex):  The example LaTeX
  code
- [figs/make-figs.ipynb](figs/make-figs.ipynb):  The jupyter notebook
  with plotting code that generated the figures
- [figs/paper.mplstyle](figs/paper.mplstyle):  The example mplstyle
  file that's used in the python code above.

This repo was based on [this other template repo](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/LaTeX-template).
